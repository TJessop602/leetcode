#One of the most poorly worded problems on the site and with completely worthless examples and testcases.
#Really, it's more or less just asking for the max height of a graph + some fluff.

    def numOfMinutes(self, n: int, headID: int, manager: List[int], informTime: List[int]) -> int:

            graph[m].append(i)

        return dfs(headID)
